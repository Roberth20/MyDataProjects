## Introduction
This repository is a curated collection of data science projects that demonstrate practical applications of EDA and machine learning techniques. Whether you're interested in data exploration, feature engineering, or predictive modeling, you'll find a diverse set of examples here.

## Projects
Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the projects included in this repository:
* **Worldwide Coffee Consumption:** <br> Description: This projects aim to apply knowledges of Data Cleaning and transforming to perform a Exploratory Data Analysis in a dataset with Coffee consumptions in more than 20 years \ Technologies: Python, Notebooks, Dash, Plotly, Pandas

## Getting Started
To get started with any of these projects, you'll need to set up a conda environment and install the necessary dependencies.

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.x
* Required libraries for each project. Inside the folders, it can be found a conda environment file to create it. You can do it with:

  ```
  conda env create --file environment.yml
  ```
### Installation
Clone the repository in your local machine
```
git clone https://github.com/Roberth20/MyDataProjects.git
cd MyDataProjects
```

## Usage
Each project includes a detailed Jupyter Notebook with explanations in each step and a Python script to run a Web application with Dash. To run the web app:
1. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd path/to/directory
```
2. Open the jupyter notebook
```
jupyter notebook project_notebook.ipynb
```
or
```
python app.py
```
Also, you can follow the instructions in each project's README file for specific usage details.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions, improvements, or additional projects to include, please follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
5. Open a Pull Request.

Please ensure your contributions adhere to the existing project style.
